# biostat626midterm

so my steps r quite simple tp follow:

1. i create a training set and validation set
2. i use lightgbm for both the binary and multiclass classification
3. i create some for loop for the result to be cateogry, instead of categorical probablities output by lightgbm.
4. i wrote the result to the txt file

BTW, i add a lot of comments in my code so it should be very easy to understand.
